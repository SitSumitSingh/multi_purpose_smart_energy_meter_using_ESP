## Smart Energy Meter using ESP-32 (IOT)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

### 1. Abstract 
The IoT-Based Smart Energy Meter is an intelligent energy monitoring system designed to measure and track voltage, current, power consumption, and cost estimation for multiple household appliances. The system utilizes an ESP32 microcontroller connected to current and voltage sensorsto obtain real-time energy data. This data is processed, displayed and sent to an IoT dashboard and stored for historical analysis.

The project incorporates relays and for remote appliance control while ensuring electrical safety. A Google Sheets webhook is integrated to log energy data for further analysis. Machine Learning algorithms can be applied to predict usage patterns and optimize energy consumption.

Key challenges such as WiFi disconnection, inaccurate sensor readings, and overheating are mitigated through automatic reconnection mechanisms, software filtering techniques, and efficient PCB design with heat management solutions. Future enhancements include AI-based load prediction, solar energy integration, and voice control via Google Assistant/Alexa.

This system provides an efficient, scalable, and cost-effective solution for home energy management, allowing users to monitor, control, and optimize energy consumption in real-time.

### 2. Introduction
The rapid growth of urbanization and industrialization has led to an exponential increase in global electricity consumption, necessitating efficient and intelligent energy monitoring systems. Traditional energy meters provide only aggregate consumption data, lacking real-time insights, remote accessibility, or intelligent load management features. This limitation hinders consumers' ability to analyze, optimize, and control their power usage effectively.

An energy meter is a device used to measure the electrical energy consumed by a residence, business, or an electrically powered device. In modern smart grid infrastructures, energy meters have evolved into digital, network-enabled systems capable of capturing real-time data, communicating with cloud platforms, and enabling bidirectional energy flow in distributed energy networks.

### 3. Problem Statement
Several existing systems use Arduino and GSM for single-load energy monitoring. However, most lack cloud integration or multi-load capability. This project aims to overcome those limitations by using:
* ESP32 for multi-load monitoring with Wi-Fi capability. 
* Google Sheets integration for cloud-based data logging. 
* Blynk IoT platform for mobile-based visualization.

### ⚙️ Current Caliberation Algorithm (SCT-013-030)
This section explains how the RMS current is calculated from the analog signal of the SCT-013-000 current sensor.

**🔄 Algorithm Steps:**
***1. Define Constants:***
   - `sensorPin` is set to **A0**, where the SCT-013-000 sensor is connected.
   - `calibration` factor is set to **30.0**, based on the burden resistor and ADC scaling.
   - `VREF` is set to **5.0V**, the Arduino's reference voltage.

***2. Initialize Serial Communication:***
   - Start **Serial Monitor** at 115200 baud for debugging and data plotting.

***3. Sampling Loop:***
   - Take **200 samples** in each loop cycle for a smooth RMS calculation.
   - For each sample:
     - Read analog value from the sensor pin using `analogRead(sensorPin)`.
     - Convert the raw value to voltage using:  
       `voltage = (sensorValue / 1023.0) * VREF`
     - Convert voltage to instantaneous current using:  
       `current = (voltage - VREF/2) * calibration`
     - Square the current and add to a running sum:  
       `sum += current * current`
     - Print the instantaneous current value to the Serial Plotter.

***4. Calculate RMS Current:***
   - After 200 samples, calculate RMS current as:  
     `rmsCurrent = sqrt(sum / sampleSize)`
   - Print the RMS current to the Serial Monitor.

***5. Delay:***
   - Wait **1 second** before repeating the loop to allow stable output.

**📌 Notes:**
- This code assumes the sensor outputs a centered AC signal around **VREF/2**.
- Adjust the `calibration` constant if using a different burden resistor or ADC resolution.

### ⚡ Voltage Caliberation Algorithm (ZMPT101B)**
This section describes how RMS voltage is measured using the ZMPT101B voltage sensor and an Arduino.

**🔄 Algorithm Steps:**
***1. Define Constants:***
   - `ZMPT101B_PIN` is set to **A0**, where the voltage sensor is connected.
   - `calibrationFactor` is set to **687**, used to convert the measured RMS voltage to the actual AC voltage.
   - `sampleCount` is set to **1000**, for higher measurement accuracy.
   - `offsetVoltage` is set to **2.5V**, assuming a centered AC waveform from the sensor.

***2. Initialize Serial Communication:***
   - Start **Serial Monitor** at **115200 baud** to view voltage readings and debug output.

***3. Sampling Loop:***
   - Initialize `squaredSum` to store the sum of squared voltages.
   - For each of the **1000 samples**:
     - Read the raw analog value from the ZMPT101B sensor:  
       `sensorValue = analogRead(ZMPT101B_PIN)`
     - Convert the raw ADC value to voltage using:  
       `voltage = sensorValue * (5.0 / 1023.0)`
     - Subtract the **offset voltage** (2.5V) to center the waveform around 0V.
     - Square the corrected voltage and add it to `squaredSum`.
     - Optionally print each corrected voltage value for visualization in the Serial Plotter.
     - Delay for **1000 microseconds** between samples for adequate resolution.

***4. Calculate RMS Voltage:***
   - After sampling, compute RMS voltage using:  
     `rmsVoltage = sqrt(squaredSum / sampleCount)`

***5. Output Results:***
   - Print the **RMS voltage**.
   - Multiply the RMS voltage by the **calibration factor** to get the final voltage reading.
   - Display both values on the **Serial Monitor**.

***6. Delay:***
   - Add a small delay (**500 ms**) before the next reading cycle.

**📌 Notes:**
- The **offset voltage** is crucial for removing the DC bias from the ZMPT101B output.
- The **calibration factor** should be adjusted based on known voltage measurements for better accuracy.
- Sampling delay and count can be fine-tuned depending on application needs (e.g., 50Hz or 60Hz mains).
